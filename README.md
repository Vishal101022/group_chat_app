# Full Stack Group-chat-app
## :grey_question: what it does
group chat app is a real-time messaging platform built using Socket.io. It allows users to join chat rooms, send and receive messages instantly, and engage in group discussions. The backend is developed using Node.js and Express, while the frontend is created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Socket.io enables bi-directional communication between the server and clients, ensuring real-time message delivery. The app also supports user authentication and displays a list of users currently active in the chat. With its seamless real-time communication, users can have interactive and immediate conversations.
